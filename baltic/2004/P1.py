# Baltic OI '04 P1 - Ships
# DMOJ: https://dmoj.ca/problem/btoi04p1

# The board of "Ships" game consists of N Ã— N squares. Each square may belong to some ship or be empty. If two squares belong to ships and have a common edge, then both squares belong to the same ship. Squares of different ships have no common points. The tonnage of a ship is the number of squares belonging to this ship.
#
# In the given example, squares belonging to ships are marked black. On the game board there are: one 29 -ton ship, three 7 -ton ships, two 4 -ton ships and three one-ton ships.
#
# Write a program which for given description of a game board calculates number of ships and tonnage of each ship.

# The first line of input contains one positive integer N .
#
# On each of the next N lines, there is given information about one board row, consecutively describing groups of squares from left to right, which belongs to ships in one of two formats:
#
#     <number_of_square_column>, if square in given column belongs to ship, but squares to the left and to the right are free;
#     <number_of_first_square_column>-<number_of_last_square_column>, if all consecutive squares from first to last (including) belong to ship and squares to the left and to the right from this group are free.
#
# Square groups are separated by commas, each line ends with a semicolon. There are no spaces in lines. If in some board row there are no ship's squares, then the corresponding line contains only one semicolon.
